Purpose:

    1. Understand the structure of a binary heap.

    2. Be able to analyze the complexities of an algorithm through experiments.

Task Description:

In this project, you are going to build a max-heap. You will use an array to implement the heap.

Your program should:

    • Allow the user to select one of the following two choices (Note that your program needs
    
      to implement both choices):
      
      o (1) test your program with 100 randomly generated integers (no duplicates, positive

      numbers with proper range);

      o (2) test your program with the following 100 fixed values from 1, 2, 3, ..., and 100.

    • Implement both methods of building a max heap:

      o Using sequential insertions (see slide 27);

      o Using the optimal method (see slide 32 – the smart way).

For both methods, you need to keep track of how many swaps (swapping parent and child are required to build a heap.

    • For choice (1), you need to generate 20 sets of randomly generated integers; compute, print

      and document (in your project report) the average number of swaps for both methods. Your

      program should output the average number of swaps for both methods (an average over 20 sets).

    • For choice (2), your program should output the first 10 integers in your array and the

      number of swaps for both methods. Then perform 10 removals on the heap and output the

      first 10 integers.
